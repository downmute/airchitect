# How to use:

# Training
Select 'Input', and enter the training data in the format: "(x1,x2,x3..,x7)=y1"
Enter as many lines of data as you want!

Build your model accordingly by dragging the blocks from the left side of the screen

Click 'Train' at the bottom to begin the training process.
When the training is finished, you'll see a graph depicting the loss of the model.
The smaller the loss, the better the accuracy!

# Inference
Click 'Inference', and enter one query in the form of your training data, like "(x1,x2,x3)"
The model will output a result according to what you submitted at the bottom of the screen

# Loading models
If you have already trained a model before, clicking 'Load Model' will load the latest model you have trained
The inference now uses the latest, loaded model
